## cbase (C Foundation Library)

*Cbase* is a C library of useful functions that simplify systems 
software development on System V UNIX. The library includes routines for 
memory management, string parsing, filesystem traversal, subprocess 
execution, I/O, as well as implementations of common data structures 
such as linked lists, hash tables, stacks, and queues. The library also 
includes a high-level interface to Berkeley sockets, and an 
implementation of a scheduler which has functionality very similar to 
that of the *cron* daemon
